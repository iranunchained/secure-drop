# Secure Drop

Secure-drop provides a way for users to securely, using browser-side PGP encryption on the client, submit files and/or messages to specified recipients in the Ethereum Foundation via a [web form](https://secure-drop.ethereum.org/).

## User flow

1. User writes a message and may select files for a selected recipient.
2. The user's browser encrypts the content using [OpenPGP.js](https://openpgpjs.org/) with a public key of the recipient, before submitting the encrypted content to the server.
3. The server uses its email delivery service to send the email to the intended recipient.
4. The recipient receives the encrypted message/file, and can then decrypt it using their private PGP key.


## Dependencies

Docker Compose.

Using [nginx-proxy](https://github.com/nginx-proxy/) for https proxy

### Third Party Services

* Sendgrid
* Google reCAPTCHA


## New setup

Make a fork of the repository. Set environment variables in `.env` file, using the provided example. Customise the templates and code. Update public keys in [static/js/public-keys.js](static/js/public-keys.js). Deploy to your web server or K8s cluster.


## Security

If the server running the service were to be compromised, this could lead to severe issues such as public keys and email addresses being changed/added so that an attacker can also read the encrypted messages.

A server operator should follow best practises for security when setting up and operating the server running the service.


## Run
```
docker compose up
```

The server will be listening on port 80 (exposed to Docker host on port 80).
